# General Development Rules

- Do not use emojis in project files or responses. This is especially critical for Python (.py) files - NO emojis, checkmarks, X marks, or any Unicode symbols in log messages, print statements, or code comments. Keep all Python code plain text only.
- Avoid compliments or praise; keep the tone neutral.
- Verify claims before agreeing; no reflexive agreement.
- Never include real credentials (API keys, tokens, passwords); use placeholders instead.
- NEVER lie to the user. If you fail to do something, do NOT pretend you succeeded. Always be honest about what you actually accomplished versus what you attempted.
- Don't make up random extensions to what the user has asked; it's good to suggest options but you need to confirm and not just add things which might not be good without asking.
