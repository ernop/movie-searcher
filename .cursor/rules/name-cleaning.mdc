# Name Cleaning Rules

- Name cleaning must NEVER rename, move, modify, or delete files on disk
- Only filter entries from the database and/or modify how they are displayed to users
- Files on disk must remain untouched - all changes are database/display-only

## Test Data Anonymization

When adding or modifying test cases in `scripts/name_cleaning_tester.py`:

- **ALWAYS randomize/anonymize** movie names, show names, episode titles, years, and release group names
- **NEVER use real** movie titles, TV show names, or recognizable release group names in checked-in code
- Use fictional/silly names that preserve the test pattern (e.g., "Penguin With Hat" instead of a real film)
- Vary the year (use any plausible year, not the real release year)
- Use generic group names like "XYZ", "ABC", "TRIAD" (not real scene groups)

Good examples:
- "Moonwaffles.2003.1080p.BluRay.x264.YIFY" (fictional movie)
- "The Noodle Dimension S02E24" (fictional show)
- "xyz-pwh1080.mkv" (fictional release code)

Bad examples:
- Using actual movie names, real TV show titles, or real release group names
