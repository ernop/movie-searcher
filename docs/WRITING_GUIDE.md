# README Writing Guide

Practical guidance for writing and updating the README.

## Purpose

The README shows:
1. What the tool does
2. What we want it to do (future ideas)
3. How to get started

Balance: **90% product features, 10% technical setup.**

## Screenshots

### What to Capture
- Actual UI screens showing real functionality
- The visual timeline feature (core differentiator)
- Filter controls in action
- Search results appearing instantly
- Movie details with clickable timestamps

### Which Films to Show
Use films that match the project's spirit:
- Documentary and experimental cinema (e.g., Koyaanisqatsi)
- Foreign films, archival footage
- Things not on streaming services
- **Not** mainstream Hollywood blockbusters

### Placement
- Inline with relevant sections, not all at the top
- Each screenshot should illustrate the text around it
- Don't need full-page captures—target what's relevant

## Content to Cover

### Features to Explain
- Visual browsing with screenshot timelines
- Screenshot generation (intervals, subtitle burning)
- Instant search (emphasize speed—no page loads)
- AI search and saved lists
- History and resume playback
- Watch status, ratings, playlists
- Launching with subtitles

### Future Ideas Section
Include what we're thinking about building:
- Dialogue search (audio transcription + full-text search)
- Visual search (image recognition for "scenes with cliffs")
- Director/actor navigation (jump to filmography)

Present as possibilities, not promises.

### Speed
Emphasize that everything is instant:
- Search results appear as you type
- No loading screens
- Click a filter, see results immediately
- Launch a movie in milliseconds

## Technical Section

Keep brief. Include:
- Requirements (Python, VLC, ffmpeg)
- Quick start command (`run.bat` or the three terminal commands)
- Link to `docs/installation.md` for details

## Structure

1. What it does (one paragraph)
2. Main screenshot (visual timeline)
3. Why we made it
4. Feature sections with inline screenshots
5. Future ideas
6. Technical setup (brief)
7. Closing line
