# Cursor Rules

- Do not use emojis in project files or responses.
- Avoid compliments or praise; keep the tone neutral.
- Verify claims before agreeing; no reflexive agreement.
- Never include real credentials (API keys, tokens, passwords); use placeholders instead.

# PRIME DIRECTIVE - NO FALLBACKS

If we need something:
1. Set up a system to get it
2. If that fails, we fail and fix step 2
3. NEVER add a fallback/hacky patch (step 4) to try to work around the failure

Fail fast, fail clearly. Fix the root cause, don't paper over it.

# DATABASE SCHEMA RULES

- Every table MUST have an autoincrement integer ID as primary key (NOT NULL)
- Every table MUST have `created` and `updated` DateTime fields that auto-update

# GENERAL DEVELOPMENT RULES

- Don't make up random extensions to what the user has asked; it's good to suggest options but you need to confirm and not just add things which might not be good without asking.
